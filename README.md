# Combining-and-Analyzing-Ad-Campaign-Data
This SQL project aims to combine data from two ad campaign platforms (Facebook Ads and Google Ads) and perform a comprehensive analysis. Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), we create a unified dataset and then aggregate metrics by date and media source.

## Key Objectives:

* Combine data from multiple sources.
* Utilize CTEs for better code readability.
* Aggregate metrics to gain insights into campaign performance.

## Methodology:

* Data Integration: Combined data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads using a UNION ALL operation.
* CTE Creation: Created a CTE to encapsulate the combined dataset.
* Aggregation: Grouped the data by date and media source to calculate total spend, impressions, clicks, and conversion value.

## Tools Used:

* SQL
